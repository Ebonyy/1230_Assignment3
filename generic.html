						<h3>The Solution</h3>
						<p>From the data, hotpots within Sydney are found in multiple areas for those who fall under particular religions. This may become a problem in the future due to the fact that there seems to be a divide between people. Australia aims to be muticultural and inclusive and in order to achieve those 'goals,' intergration and an inclusive environment is needed. 

						<br>
						<br>

						Essesntially the design is supposed to be open and without restrictive linear walls, therefore allowing a open and free space that can be adapted to the users needs. The changiablity is therefore important, as the space can be intergrated into allowing for large meetup and sharing of cultures and intermingling. Religious afflicted festivals could be held here, and anyone can access it as the space is designated for all. The education for those outside the religion will generate conversation and thus disapate any fear or concern for those who lack knowledge about specfic religious groups

						<br>
						<br>

						People can access the site from multiple parts of sydney, through cool covered escaltators, and elevators so it is accessible for everyone.

								<h3>The Main Hotspots</h3>
								<p>The areas gathered from the cenus data analysis was that there were four main religions and 6 main hotspots. The Jewsih mainly resided in the East Coast of Sydney, the Islamic in Bankstown and Yagoona, the Buddist in Canley Vale and Cabramatta and the Christian denominations residing mainly in the north side of Sydney. These hotspots is where the site is accessible from, so those from all over Sydney can use and vist the site with ease.</p>
